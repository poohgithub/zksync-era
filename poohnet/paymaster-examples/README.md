# Paymaster Examples Repository 📁

![](./paymaster-examples.png)

Welcome to the world of Paymasters!! 🎉 🌍 🎉

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**: Please note that none of the contracts in this repository have been fully audited or extensively tested. These contracts are examples and, therefore, are **not** designed for production use.

This repository houses a variety of example Paymaster Contracts demonstrating different use cases. Plus, a user-friendly, configurable frontend to interact with these examples, developed using React and Next.js. 

## Repository structure 🏗️

The repository is divided into two main sections:

- `/contracts`: This directory contains the smart contracts, where each sub-directory represents a unique Paymaster use case. 

- `/frontend`: This directory hosts the frontend developed using React and Next.js. The frontend allows you to interact with the various Paymaster contracts provided.

## Commands 💻

Here are some useful commands to get started:

- `yarn compile:contracts`: Compiles the contracts.
- `yarn deploy:contracts`: This command deploys contracts. Scripts for deployment can be found in the `/contracts/deploy` directory.
- `yarn test:contracts`: Runs contract tests. **Please ensure to check the test requirements in /contracts directory.**
- `yarn serve:ui`: Serves up frontend on `localhost:3000`
- `yarn format`: Runs prettier formatter.
